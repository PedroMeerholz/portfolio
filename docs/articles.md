#### **Resumo**
<p align="justify">
With Industry 4.0, the integration between physical and digital environments enabled some improvements within several production segments. Among these improvements, advancements on the application of machine learning algorithms to predict current and future states of equipment have been gaining attention, specially, for maintenance purposes. This research work presents a comparative experimental study on machine learning algorithms applied to classification of industrial machinery states. After training and evaluating models based on five different algorithms (i.e., Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, XGBoost and Neural Network), some interesting results were obtained. Considering the accuracy, precision, recall and training time of each model, it was observed that some models performed well, while others may not be as suitable for solving the problem. Such good performing models could be used to schedule interventions on a given industrial equipment, avoiding production stoppages.
